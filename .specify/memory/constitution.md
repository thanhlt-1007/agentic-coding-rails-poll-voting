<!--
SYNC IMPACT REPORT - Constitution Update
========================================
Version Change: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
Type: MINOR (Deployment target change)

Modified Principles: None
Modified Sections:
  - Technology Stack > Deployment: Updated from Kamal 2.0 to Render.com
  - Development Standards > Workflow: Added Render.com deployment notes

Rationale: 
  Render.com provides managed PostgreSQL, Redis, and automatic deployments
  from Git, reducing infrastructure complexity and maintenance overhead.
  No Docker containerization needed - Render uses native buildpacks.

Template Consistency Status:
  ✅ plan-template.md - No changes required
  ✅ spec-template.md - No changes required
  ✅ tasks-template.md - No changes required

Follow-up TODOs:
  - Configure render.yaml for service definitions
  - Set up environment variables in Render dashboard
  - Configure database connection pooling for Render PostgreSQL

# Rails Poll Voting Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rails-First Architecture

All features MUST leverage Rails conventions and built-in capabilities before introducing external dependencies. The Rails Way is the default choice:
- Use Rails generators for scaffolding (models, controllers, migrations)
- Follow MVC pattern strictly: fat models, skinny controllers
- Leverage Active Record for data operations; avoid raw SQL unless performance-critical
- Use Turbo/Hotwire for dynamic interactions (SSR-first, minimal JavaScript)
- Partials and ViewComponents for reusable UI elements
- Background jobs via Active Job (Solid Queue for Rails 8+)

**Rationale**: Rails conventions reduce cognitive load, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency. The framework's maturity means most problems have established patterns.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD is mandatory for all feature work. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced:
1. Write failing test (RSpec system/request/model specs)
2. Get user/stakeholder approval on test scenarios
3. Verify test fails for the right reason
4. Implement minimum code to pass
5. Refactor while keeping tests green

**Test coverage requirements**:
- System tests for critical user journeys (voting flows, poll creation)
- Request tests for all controller actions
- Model tests for validations, associations, business logic
- Minimum 90% coverage on models and services

**Rationale**: Tests are executable specifications. Writing them first ensures we build what's needed, not what's easy. Early validation prevents costly rewrites.

### III. SSR Performance & User Experience

Server-side rendering is the primary delivery mechanism. Performance budgets enforced:
- Time to First Byte (TTFB): < 200ms (p95)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1

**Implementation requirements**:
- Fragment caching for expensive partials (Russian Doll caching)
- Database query optimization: eager loading (N+1 prevention), proper indexes
- Turbo Frames for isolated updates without full page reload
- Progressive enhancement: full functionality without JavaScript
- Responsive design mobile-first (Tailwind CSS preferred)

**Rationale**: SSR ensures fast initial page loads, better SEO, and accessibility. Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and retention.

### IV. Security by Default

Security is built-in, not bolted-on. Rails security features MUST be enabled:
- Strong parameters for all controller inputs (no mass assignment)
- CSRF protection enabled (verify_authenticity_token)
- Content Security Policy headers configured
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries/Active Record
- XSS prevention via automatic HTML escaping in ERB
- Authentication via Devise or Rails built-in has_secure_password
- Authorization via Pundit or Action Policy (explicit policies)

**Additional requirements**:
- Secrets managed via Rails credentials (encrypted)
- HTTPS enforced in production (force_ssl = true)
- Rate limiting on public endpoints (Rack::Attack)
- Regular dependency updates (bundle audit, brakeman scans)

**Rationale**: Security breaches destroy trust. Prevention is orders of magnitude cheaper than remediation.

### V. Simplicity & Maintainability

Start with the simplest solution that works. Complexity requires explicit justification:
- YAGNI: Don't build features until they're needed
- Convention over configuration: use Rails defaults unless strong reason to deviate
- Single Responsibility Principle: classes/methods do one thing well
- Avoid premature optimization: measure before optimizing
- Code review focus: "Can a Rails developer unfamiliar with this feature understand it?"

**Complexity triggers (require architectural review)**:
- Adding new gems (must justify over Rails built-in)
- Introducing services/patterns not in core Rails (e.g., Command pattern, Event Sourcing)
- Custom middleware or Rack apps
- Multi-database configurations
- Background job complexity beyond simple enqueue/perform

**Rationale**: Simple code is maintainable code. Rails' sweet spot is conventional applications; fighting the framework creates maintenance debt.

## Technology Stack

**Core**:
- Ruby 4.0+ (latest stable)
- Rails 8.0+ (leveraging Solid Queue, Solid Cache, Solid Cable)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (primary database)
- Redis 7+ (caching, session store)

**Frontend**:
- Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) for SPA-like interactions
- Tailwind CSS 4+ for styling
- ViewComponent for reusable UI components
- Importmap for JavaScript dependencies (no build step unless unavoidable)

**Testing**:
- RSpec (system, request, model specs)
- FactoryBot for test data
- Faker for realistic fake data
- Capybara for system tests
- SimpleCov for coverage tracking

**Development**:
- Rubocop with Rails cops (style enforcement)
- Brakeman (security scanning)
- Bullet (N+1 detection)
- bundler-audit (dependency vulnerability checks)

**Deployment**:
- Render.com (managed platform - PostgreSQL, Redis, web services)
- Native buildpacks (no Docker required)
- GitHub integration for automatic deployments
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

## Development Standards

**Code Quality Gates** (must pass before merge):
1. All tests passing (RSpec suite green)
2. Rubocop violations: zero
3. Brakeman warnings: zero (or explicitly documented exceptions)
4. Coverage: minimum 90% on new/changed code
5. PR review: minimum one approval from maintainer

**Workflow**:
- Feature branches: `###-feature-name` (issue number prefix)
- Commits: conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`)
- PRs: include spec reference, test coverage, migration plan if applicable
- Database migrations: reversible, tested in Render preview environments before production
- Deployment: Automatic on merge to `main` (via Render.com GitHub integration)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- README updated for new user-facing features
- Inline comments for non-obvious business logic
- API documentation via RDoc for public methods
- Database schema maintained (schema.rb automatically tracked)

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all ad-hoc practices. When in doubt, constitution rules.

**Amendment Process**:
1. Propose change via issue (include rationale, migration plan)
2. Team discussion (minimum 3 business days for feedback)
3. Approval requires consensus (all maintainers agree or no blocking objections)
4. Update constitution version (semantic versioning)
5. Update dependent templates/docs within same PR
6. Announce change in team channel with migration timeline

**Compliance**:
- All PRs reviewed for constitutional alignment
- Quarterly constitution review (identify outdated sections)
- Exceptions require written justification and expiration date
- Automated checks where possible (Rubocop, Brakeman, CI gates)

**Runtime Guidance**:
- Developers consult `.specify.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project-specific rules
- Template commands reference constitution for validation gates
- Onboarding checklist includes constitution review

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-10 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-10
